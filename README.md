## MyStatsYT
My stats YT allow you to check your own personal YouTube video consumption stats.

The current version is a client-only (no server, just API calls) that works as a Lite version for people that don't want their stats going around third-party servers. 



###Sketch
The intial concept is represtend in the sketch below:

Key differences to call-out from the sketch to the final version: 
- removed "genre" list option: found out later there's no YouTube API with such information currently (Sept/2021). Might consider a possible 3rd party API in the future.
- renamed "artist" by "channel": found out that even YouTube Music interprets the Channel name as "Artist" name. Still, the Artist names are now always consistent to the "real" Video artist given Channel names are not always reflective of the Artist name themselves. 
- Menu is retractible to be add more pannel space.
